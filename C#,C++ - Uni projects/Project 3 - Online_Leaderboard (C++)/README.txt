Advanced Technologies: Online Leaderboard

The purpose of this project is to research the game mechanic of online multiplayer leader board and trophy systems and develop and evaluate a model using existing and/or innovative methods.

Developed with: C++ and DarkGDK for visual studio (Server: C++, Client: C++ & DarkGDK)

This project comes with two executables, one for the server application and the other for a client application.

If no connection to the server can be established then the client will still be able to play the game but no high score table will be avalaible. 

In the event that the server is not running then please refer to the documentation for insight into how the high score mechanic works aswell as a demo on video diary 5 video link in the apendix.

The main menu screen of the client application consists of two options:

Play
High scores

The aim of the game is to click on the red square as it appears on the screen to make it disappear again and after a delay reappear at another random location to be clicked on again. Each successful click results in a point gain and miss clicking or running out of time will result in the game ending.

Advanced Technologies: Play Replay

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and evaluate a method for time manipulation mechanics in games and the research of some technical solutions for doing so.

Developed with: C++ and DarkGDK for visual studio

Their are two executables avaliable with the project, one demonstrating 5 objects and the other 50 objects, these are prepared for release so will not require any additional software other than the possibility that directX is needed on the machine. Please ensure that the executables are launched as they come with their sprite files in the same directory and if they are moved that these are moved with them.

The purpose for the choice between 5 and 50 objects being demonstrated is that it may be easier to observe events with less objects on screen.

The code has been supplied with the project and can be opened in visual studio although installing DarkGDK for visual studio 2008 is a requirement for being able to rebuild the project.

Controls:

Down Key = Pause time
Left Key = Reverse time for everything
Right Key = Reverse time for yellow objects
Up Key = Reverse time for red objects
Left mouse click = Place time freeze bubble

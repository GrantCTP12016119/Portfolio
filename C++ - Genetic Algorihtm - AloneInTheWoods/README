This is a build of my genetic algorithm example. The idea is that the agent will slowly learn to survive in its surroundings whilst 
doing an even balance of essesial things such as drinking, hunting, building shelters and sleep

I must also emphisise that this was a progamming based project and so the focus was not the presentation as I'm sure you'll agree.

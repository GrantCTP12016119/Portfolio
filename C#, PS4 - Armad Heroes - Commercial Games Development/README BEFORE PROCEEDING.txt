Armad heroes is a collection of games developed for the PS4 using unity. My group were respnsible for the production of Zone Patrol (one of the games that is playable through armad heroes). This is a territory based game where each player must compete to control the territory on the map whilst engaging in combat.

CONTROLLERS THAT ARE CONNECTED VIA USB SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AUTOMATICALLY BUT PLEASE ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO INSTALL THE NESSESARY DRIVERS.

Up to 8 players can play using split controllers.

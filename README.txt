Thses are a collection of some of my academic and recreational projects over the years.

Be sure to have a look at the Armad Heroes game Zone Patrol aswell as my dissertation project Procedural generation and AI path finding.

Helios is an autonomous photovore robot. No arduino was used, this was built from the ground up with the chasis being constructed out of cardboard and the curcuit board contains an Atmel micro controller which I programmed in C, the code for which can be found above.

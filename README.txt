Grant Medlyn

This is my portfolio with a few of my projects, some projects have been developed during my degree whilst others have been projects that I underwent in my free time.

Be sure to have a look at the Armad Heroes game Zone Patrol aswell as my disseration project Procedural generation and AI path finding.

As you can see many of my projects have been written in C++, this is my strongest language by far however I do have expereience working with C# and find myself comfrotable with it. I am very familiar and comfortable with Object oreiented programming and you can see some examples of it in my code files. Furthermore I also have some expereience working in Java.

These projects are taken from various points of my experience including points at which I was in the process of learning certain programming languages/paradigms.
